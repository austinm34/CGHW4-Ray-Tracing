# CGHW4
CGHW4 raytracing

This was compiled and edited in Visual Studio 2017
needs eigen 3.3.7 to run

I added a plane and triangle class that can render and intersect with rays
I added color and reflectivity to all shapes

I added phong shading, and shadows

I attempted to add reflections, almost got it working but not quite.
